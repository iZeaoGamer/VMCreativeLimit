Welcome to the first ever coded plugin I have made. This plugin is not yet ready for download, but you may soon get it on poggit. (Updating links soon.)

What does this plugin do?
This plugin basically limits you to do certain things in creative mode, such as: Opening chests in c mode, and what not.
This plugin also updates: /gmc - /creative, and /gms - /survival.
Let me know if you have any errors enabling the plugin, and I will try fixing it ASAP.
Thank you for reading, I will update you all very soon.
