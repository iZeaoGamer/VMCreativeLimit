Welcome to the first ever coded plugin I have made.
UPDATED - Download now available here: https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/iZeaoGamer/VMCreativeLimit/VMCreativeLimit

What does this plugin do?
This plugin basically limits you to do certain things in creative mode, such as: Opening chests in c mode, and what not.
This plugin also updates: /gmc - /creative, and /gms - /survival.
Let me know if you have any errors enabling the plugin, and I will try fixing it ASAP.
Thank you for reading, I will update you all very soon.
